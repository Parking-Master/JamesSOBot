[Learned Commands can be found here](#learned-commands)
To interact with the bot simply enter your command with the following prefix:\`||\`.
\`\`\`
|| commandName arg1 arg2 arg3
\`\`\`
The [eval](#eval) command has a shortcut of \`||>\`. See the examples in the eval section for how to use this.
The eval is sandboxed. If you find a vulnerability please contact me or a Room Owner immediately. They will be able to shut down the bot until it is fixed.
